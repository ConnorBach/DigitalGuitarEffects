Digital Guitar Effect Modeling

This program models digital guitar effects on a sample recording. Currently the program can apply overdrive, distortion, 
reverb, tremolo, and flanger effects. The distortion and reverb effects allow for user input to determine the magnitude of the
generated effect. The program graphs the original signal and the transformed signal after each effect is applied.
